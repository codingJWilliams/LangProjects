Create a program which will take as an input a graph and output either a Eulerian path or a Eulerian cycle, or state that it is not possible.  A Eulerian Path starts at one node and traverses every edge of a graph  through every node and finishes at another node.  A Eulerian cycle is a eulerian Path that starts and finishes at the same node.
